## 🌍 Our Worlds

### **Rule of Rika**
A mythic-ethnographic space opera setting rich in political intrigue, military conflict and soft sci-fi wonder. Alien civilizations with radically different biologies, cultures, and economies leverage their strengths in a cosmic contest orchestrated by the sentient planetoid Rika.

### **Atomic Horizon**
A retrofuturist setting where humanity survives in a corporate-dominated Solar System at the end of the 21st century. After Earth fell to the Engramized Singularity, corporations rule the colonies, fusion reactors power expansion, and wars are fought over fusion fuel and orbital territories.

### **H.A.V.E.N**
A supernatural-noir setting steeped in crime, occult mystery, and urban paranoia. Every deal has a price and every truth is poisoned, drawing players into webs of power, corruption, and forbidden knowledge.
